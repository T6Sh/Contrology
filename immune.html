        <p>These days the positive impact of exercise on both physical and mental well-being is highly publicised. But what about boosting our resistance to more communicable diseases such as the flu and the common cold? Can exercise also boost immune function and improve our chances of resisting these types of conditions as well?</p>
<br>
    <h4><b>HEALTH BENEFITS OF EXERCISE</b></h4>
<p>Exercise plays a powerful role in maintaining good heart, lung, bone, muscular and metabolic health. It also assists in the management and prevention of a number of non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, type II diabetes, asthma and osteoporosis (just to name a few!). Exercise also contributes significantly to managing mental health and mood. This is through a number of pathways including the increased secretion of endorphins or “feel good hormones” such as serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine, all of which play an important role in regulating your mood. Equally important, exercise can also suppress the secretion of stress hormones such as cortisol leaving you feeling more upbeat and capable to take on the world!</p>
<br>
<h4><b>SO, WHAT ABOUT EXERCISE FOR IMMUNITY?</b></h4>
<p>
There has been much research and debate in recent times regarding the effect of exercise in enhancing immune function and reducing one’s risk of contracting communicable or infectious. While this is an ongoing area of research, recent studies have shown that acute bouts (classified as sixty minutes or less) of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise can lead to the increased recruitment and secretion of a number of proteins and substances such as immunoglobulin and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Both of these are involved with enhancing metabolic health and immune activity.</p>

<p>And consistency counts, too!</p>

<p>It appears that engaging in regular exercise over your lifespan can also slow immune function decline along with the changes that can occur with ageing, therefore reducing the risk of infection as we age.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>GETTING ENOUGH EXERCISE</b></h4>
<p>So, how much exercise should you be doing?</p>

<p>The Australian Physical Activity Guidelines recommend adults engage in a minimum of thirty minutes of physical activity per day, with an accumulation of 150-300 minutes of moderate intensity or 75-150 minutes of vigorous intensity physical activity per week. Examples of moderate intensity physical activity can includesk walking, golf, dancing, bike riding, recreational swimming, Pilates, yoga or even household chores such as vacuuming, raking and gardening. Examples of vigorous intensity exercise can include heavy weightlifting, running, bike riding at a greater speed, HIIT type workouts and spin classes. They also recommend strengthening exercise twice a week along with aiming to frequentlyak up sedentary time, limiting it to no more than one hour at a time.</p>

<p>Likewise, older adults (classified as those 65 years and older) are encouraged to accumulate at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity on most, but preferably all days. This should be a range of activities including aerobic, strength, flexibility and balance.</p>

<p>The recommendations differ slightly for children, who are recommended to complete at least sixty minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day. It is also recommended children limit sedentary time to no more than two hours a day and are also encouraged toak up their sedentary time throughout the day. The guidelines also recommend that children between 5-13 years should accumulate 9-11 hours sleep a night while 14-17 year olds should aim for 8-10 hours uninterrupted sleep per night.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>BUT HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH?</b></h4>
<p>Among many in society there is a common misconception that exercise has a negative impact on immune function, leading to one increasing their susceptibility to disease. However, research has shown this is not entirely true.</p>

<p>It’s true that when it comes to exercise and immunity, there appears to be a “sweet spot” when it comes to duration and frequency of exercise dosage. For most of us though, we won’t come close to reaching the threshold for “too much” exercise!</p>

<p>Research has shown the load required to suppress immune function is one only commonly seen in elite athletes during intense training blocks where they are engaging in a high load of vigorous intensity activity for a prolonged period of time, often in conjunction with multiple competitions. However, this is commonly coupled with other stressors which researchers claim could also contribute to this immune suppression including changes in sleep patterns, reduced energy intake along with travel and psychological factors.</p>
