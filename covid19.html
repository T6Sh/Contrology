    <p>For Muslims around Australia, Ramadan is an important and holy month which is marked by the practice of sawm, or fasting. The practice of fasting during Ramadan means that Muslims may not eat or drink anything including water while the sun is shining. Managing daily exercise requirements can be more challenging during this time, and the current COVID-19 pandemic is making things even more difficult. We asked Accredited Exercise Physiologist, Mohamed Saad, for his tips on exercising safely during this year’s Ramadan celebration.</p>
    <h4>TIPS FOR EXERCISING DURING RAMADAN:</h4>
    <ul>
    	<li>Don’t skip suhoor (Pre-dawn meal)! Make sure you have something to eat, even as little as dates and plenty of water.</li>
    	<l1>If working from home, give yourself regular breaks (i.e. work for 30 minutes, get up and take 30 steps).</l1>
<li>Plan an exercise diary so you can stay on track with daily exercise.</li>
<li>Find an exercise routine that you can continue with after Ramadan in order to maintain all the good work you have achieved in the month.</li>
<li>Aim to complete at least 30 minutes of exercise each day. You can break this up throughout the day, (i.e. walk 10 minutes in the morning, do 10 minutes of light gardening in the afternoon and then 10 minutes of strength exercises at night).</li>
<li>Do some light stretches before and after reading the Quran (Islamic scripture) or praying your salat (Prayers).
Break up sitting for long periods when reading the Quran with regular short breaks to avoid your muscles and joints getting too stiff.</li>
<li>Avoid high intensity exercise such as lifting heavy weights or sprinting.</li>
<li>Do light to moderate exercises instead such as walking, light garden duties (i.e. watering the plants, light pruning) and basic home strength exercises.</li>
